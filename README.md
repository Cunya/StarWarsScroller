# Experiment to create a Star Wars scroller with Three.js using a language model

Originally, I tried to use a locally hosted **Deepseek R1** with **Cline** in Visual Studio Code, but my attempts failed. 

Just to see whether Claude can do it, I tried it with **Claude 3.5**, and even the one-shot attempt was acceptable. 

This is around the **5th iteration** with some fixes.
